            During my time at Numina, I worked on the Data Science / Data Insights team, where the main duties were to work on the research,
            testing, and development of Numina's geospatial sensors. While there are basic team structures, since Numina is still
            a relatively small company, team members often worked between teams and help out where they can.
             Numina is a start-up based out of NYC, backed by NYU Future Labs that 
            is working to create real time sensors that track traffic and street data to provide urban planners and city officials with 
            actionable insights.

            Built a Python based data ingestion service that continuously pulls an AWS s3 instance to convert a

            <br> 
            Developed and employed a computer vision tool to perform entity detection of a real time video stream of traffic

            <br>
            <br> 
            Compiled and analyzed accuracy statistics of over 500 video sequences, providing actionable
